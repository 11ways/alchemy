## 0.1.0 (WIP)

* Remove mongoose & MongoDB eval code (still need to add validation support)
* Added sluggable behaviour
* Added Object.isEmpty method
* Array.cast converts array-like objects to regular arrays (but not Strings),
  if the variable is undefined an empty array is returned
* Add 'score' method to String prototype, to determine how similar strings are
* Add 'alchemy.after' method, which will do something after the given event has
  been emitted, even if it has been emitted in the past
* Add hasValue and getValueKey to Object, also works on arrays
* When saving data you can pass the 'allowedIndexes' option, which should be an
  array of indexes allowed to be looked through for existing records.
  If it's an empty array, only the _id will be used. If it's false, every index
  is used.
* Add 'divide' method to Object, which creates a new array where every key-value
  pair is a new object

## 0.0.1 (2014-04-04)

* Finalise version 0.0.1 after a year of initial development,
  now we can start removing mongoose.
